## "When should I start a new chat?"
You should restart the chat when we complete a Phase (from Section 4 of the spec).

Why: A "Phase" usually involves 50–100 turns of conversation. That is the safe limit for most LLMs before they get "tired."

How:

Tell me: "We finished Phase 1."

Ask me to summarize the code state.

Copy that summary + The Spec File -> New Chat.
